This is my submission for ASSIGNMENT NAME [put the name in the title too!]. I have checked the files changed in this pull request (below), and it contains only the code I wrote for this assignment, not any other assignments.

I discussed this assignment with these students: NAMES

## Comments and questions

[Answer any questions from the assignment here. If you have any comments on the assignment or requests for the TA, place them here as well.]

## Academic integrity

I certify that this assignment is my own work, and that:

- Any material from outside sources (online, books, or otherwise) is clearly marked, with a citation provided. Any code from the course lecture notes is also marked.
- I followed the collaboration policy in the syllabus, and did not look at any other student's code (or have them dictate it to me). I did not share my code with any other student.
- All students I discussed the assignment with are listed above.

I understand that violation of this policy is considered academic dishonesty, and has serious consequences, including course failure.

If I have any questions about the policies in the syllabus, I will contact the instructors.

Signed,
