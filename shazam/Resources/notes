from shamindras:
signature is at the song level
spectrogram is frequency vs time matrix!! not just image
  smooth frequency time representation of signal
spectrograms are already fourier transformed!!
spectrogram noise filteration using low pass filter to get constellation matrix
 constellation matrix then gets hashed frequency dictionary
fingerprint of spectrogram using

locally sensitive hashing

spectrogram is and windowed periodgramed already

hash borrows information of neighboring peaks before generating structure

into figerpreing dict,
   from hz and time, you get a hash




from nick

# sampling frequency  use octaves (5)
# fs of 1 is spectral denssity
# average the seroe to mono
# spectrogram is also time component
# periodogram is just density or power

# calculate value of octaves
# get max power in octaves
# 16 values

do a spectrogram!
when we find peaks, we want to put attention forwards in time.
hashes are at a frequency dimension

from local peak and the expected peaks close to it in both time and frequency to unique hash. frequency based peaks
