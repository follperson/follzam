Reflection:

I've come to this course with a basic understanding of git from a pretty 
'seat of the pants' 2/3-person-technology-team. That means I knew about 
bitbucket and github, commits, branching and pushing. However I primarily 
used the IDE (pycharm) for my needs, and was pretty ignorant of 
what was happening under the hood. This was a pretty helpful exercise both
employing the basic commands which I already knew (commit, push, pull, fetch,
branch, checkout, revert) using the shell, as well as exploring new commands 
like tagging and multiple remote management through aliasing. This reinforced my
 basic understanding, and exposed me to traversing the commit tree via the 
command line (i.e. not only using github/bitbucket tools). I think 
that that capability, to locate specific commits, filter the commit history
by message, tag, hash or banch, is the most useful thing I picked up. 
I'm still a bit confused on how to traverse this commit tree with multiple branches, 
but the resources you provided seem informative and I'll have to go back to them. 
I also think that a super useful thing is super specifically specifiying which 
file you want from any given commit. In Pycharm I think this was called 'cherry picking'
though I'm not sure as I avoided it, and often manually forced changes which I now
realize I could have accessed using the version control system. Though I don't know 
how much I'll use that in this class, primarily relying on linear individual 
development, it will definitiely be useful in application with others.
