I correctly identified the suspect as Jeremy Bowers
To reach this conclusion I went used bash techniques and my sharp deductive reasoning skills, honed through years slouging through the worst mankind has to offer. 

First I wanted to search for the exact text "CLUE" in the crimescene file, as suggested in the instructions
	grep -c 4 "CLUE" mystery/crimescene
I found the three clues, being: Suspect is over 6' tall. Suspect belonged to four specific clubs, and that there is a witness who is a lady from new zealand named Annabel. 
First I looked into the interviews folder, for this miss Annabel, using
	grep -i -c 5 "annabel" interview*
Nothing. Then I went to look for New Zealand, with:
	grep -i -c 5 "zealand" interview*
which got me to Ms. Sun, who is not the witness in question as she is not from new Zealand. 
Then I decided to look for the perp, using his membership in specific programs
	grep -i -c 5 "bash" interview*
to find that Mr. Mike Bostock is a prime candidate (tall, belongs to the right clubs), 
BUT he has a pretty strong alibi. Got my eye on him tho.... lets look elsewhere.

Then I looked into the people file using
	head people
which showed me how to 'conduct interviews'. 
Looked for Bostock again, then looked for his address in the streets directory
Found an interview to check out, but it just turned be back to the one which cleared his name already. dead end.
	grep "Bostock" people
	head streets/Senders* -n 289 |tail -n 5
	cat interviews/interview-290346
	=( 
Then I thought to follow up with the Annabel, found the four Annabels in the people file 
	grep -l "annabel" people
and looked each of em up via the people -> address -> interview pipeline. 
I wrote out the generic function below. In practice i subbed out the <line_no>, <street_name> and <interview_no> manually each time.
	head streets/<street_name> -n <line_no> | tail -n 1
	cat interviews/interview-<interview_no>
Our girl annabel CHURCH had the scoop we were looking for, pointing us to a BLUE HONDA car with a license plate starting with L337 and ending in 9. yes! 
Run over to the vehicles table and after doing a quick perusing with "cat vehicles" I put:
	grep -c 6 "L337" vehicles
which was too much output to handle, so I narrowed down the criteria and only grabbed the 'Owner' line
	grep -A 6 "L337" vehicles | grep-A Honda | grep -A Blue | grep Owner:
This dropped a handful of leads on me! 
Aron Pilhofer, Joe Germuska, Jeremy Bowers, and Erika Owens, Heather Bilings, Jacqui Miller.  
I looked at the male sounding names first, in much the same pipeline as before.
I implemented largely the same name lookup and same interview plugin, but slightly less generic noise.
	head streets/<street_name> -n <line_no> | tail -n 1 | grep -o "#.*"	
Everyone had an alibi and/or was not the right gender and/or was too short  and/or wasnt in the right membership programs), 
EXCEPT Jeremy Bowers, who was not there to defend himself.
I looked up Jeremy Bowers in the membership clubs and found he belonged in all the suspicious clubs....
	grep -l -i  "Jeremy Bowers" memberships/*
He is also the right height at 6' 1" (and his car matched but we already knew that)
	
So it looks like jeremy is the guyy! Checking the answer via the md5sum and comparing agains tthe encoded answer gets us where we neeed to go!!
check my hunch:
echo "Jeremy Bowers" | $(command -v md5 || command -v md5sum) -v md5sum)
	returns a md5hash sum (input below)
grep -qi "32cacbec4b918e2fd130fd68cf818ae5" encoded && echo CORRECT\! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE. || echo SORRY, TRY AGAIn
	 CORRECT\! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE.
	-> CORRECT! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE.
	
Sorry Mr. Bowers, your time is up. Hope you are enjoying your vacation because it is your last for a long time!
